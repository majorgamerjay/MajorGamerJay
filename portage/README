MajorGamerJay's Portage configuration for GNU/Linux

Use for reference only or your system will have a high chance to break.

I use Gentoo Linux's package manager Portage to get softwares within the
distribution. It is a highly configurable source-based package manager that
compiles the programs with according to feature flags (e.g. USE flags).

A few things before using my configuration for any purposes. Always
remember that consistency > convenience; using it directly will break your
system. Start with no USE flags, and then slowly build up to all the
features to make your new Gentoo system.

I reinstalled gentoo on 4th April, 2022 and re-updated the whole portage dir
in this repository on 4/30/22.
