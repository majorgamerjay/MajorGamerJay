# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my personal GitHub profile! I'm a 16 year old guy who loves tinkering with programs.
New to programming and Linux overall (1 year?) and love to break systems and programs. ^\_^

If you want to see my configurations for various things, see the respository of this README.md file.

- I like to write stuff and I have a passion for games, mainly RPG (currently playing *Tales of Berseria*) and FPS (CSGO, R6).
- I use Gentoo mainly due to it's extensible features and ease of use for non-standard systems.
- Love to use C, NodeJS, Python. Learning functional programming languages for better understanding (**lisp**)
